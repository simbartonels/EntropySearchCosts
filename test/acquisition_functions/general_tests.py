This class contains tests generally applying to all acquisition functions. I.e. the tests in here
model expected behaviour from the perspective of the chooser.

        Calls the acquisition function twice with the same argument. This MUST yield the same value.

        Tests that the acquisition functions can be used in parallel.

    def test_does_not_touch_gp(self):
        '''
        Asserts that acquisition functions don't change the given Gaussian process. Necessary since they share it.

    def test_is_pickable(self):
        '''
        Asserts that acquisition functions is pickable. Necessary for multiprocessing.
